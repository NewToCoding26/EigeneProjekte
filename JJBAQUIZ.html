            <p class="text">

                Prepare yourself for a fun and engaging journey through different levels of trivia mastery. <br>
                This quiz is designed for everyone, whether you’re just starting with the anime or you’re a long time manga reader. I divided the quiz into three levels of difficulty: <br>
                
                <strong>Beginner:</strong> Perfect for those who are just beginning the anime or watched it just casually. These questions will build your confidence. <br>
                <strong>Fan:</strong> If you’ve got some knowledge under your belt, ready for a bit more of a challenge and call yourself an JJBA enthusiast, this is the level for you. <br>
                <strong>Veteran:</strong> For the trivia warriors who thrive on tough questions, obscure facts and read the latest JJBA chapter, this level will put your skills to the ultimate test! <br>
                No matter which level you start with, there’s something here for everyone. So, choose your level, dive in, and see how far you can go. <br> <br> Good luck!</p>
